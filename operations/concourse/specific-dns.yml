  # With the latest BOSH they introduced bosh-dns, which pops a bosh-own DNS nameserver
  # in front of the system ones, in the VMs and in the container. In our opinion, we
  # shouldn't be exposing the BOSH-internal names in Concourse. Actually, the real
  # reason is that bosh-dns is *slow* and causes CATS to time out and fail.
